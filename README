This is an upload of Bill McNeal's stanfordparser rubygem, check it out at its homepage (seems to be partially in French)

http://rubyforge.org/projects/stanfordparser/

or its rdocs

http://stanfordparser.rubyforge.org/

I'll probably be extending this in alternate branches as I use it to prod at the Stanford Parser. For now, I've decided to leave master totally stock except for this README explaining it, unless I come up with stuff that I think would compliment Bill's work and would be useful to others.

AFAIK there aren't other copies of this on github, please correct me if I'm mistaken. The only similar one I can see is http://github.com/tiendung/ruby-nlp which has much less code and I can only assume to be something else.

See README.orig for Bill's readme, which includes dependencies, installation, and usage.


Sincerely,
John Wilkinson
